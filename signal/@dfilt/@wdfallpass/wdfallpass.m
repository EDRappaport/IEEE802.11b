%WDFALLPASS  Wave digital allpass filter.
%   Hd = DFILT.WDFALLPASS(C) constructs a wave digital filter allpass
%   structure given the allpass coefficients in vector C.%
%
%   C must have between one, two, or four coefficients. When C has exactly
%   four coefficients, the first and third coefficient must be equal to
%   zero.
%
%   The allpass transfer function of Hd given the coefficients in C is:
%                           -1          -n
%             C(n) + C(n-1)z + .... +  z
%     H(z) = -------------------------------
%                      -1             -n
%             1 + C(1)z + .... + C(n)z
%
%   The allpass coefficients are internally converted to wave digital
%   filters for filtering purposes. Note that only stable filters are
%   allowed. Also notice that the leading '1' coefficient in the
%   denominator is not part of C.
%
%   It is possible to construct a cascade of these filters using
%   DFILT.CASCADEWDFALLPASS. See the help for that filter structure for
%   more information.
%
%   DFILT.WDFALLPASS and DFILT.CASCADEWDFALLPASS have the same number of
%   multipliers than DFILT.ALLPASS and DFITL.CASCADEALLPASS respectively.
%   However they contain fewer states. On the other hand, they require more
%   adders.
%
%   Example: Construct a second-order wave digital allpass filter
%   C = [1.5,0.7];
%   Hd = dfilt.wdfallpass(C);
%   info(Hd)
%   realizemdl(Hd) % Requires Simulink; build model for filter

function blocksetup(Hd)
%BLOCKSETUP Setup the filter object to the correct blocklength in
%preparation for calling the block method.
%
% This method is used by filterbuilder where we cannot error out and ask
% the user to change the block length of the DFILT object since the user
% does not have a handle to a DFILT object in that case.

%ISINCHP  Construct an inverse-sinc highpass filter designer.
%   D = FDESIGN.ISINCHP constructs an inverse-sinc highpass filter designer D.
%
%   D = FDESIGN.ISINCHP(SPEC) initializes the filter designer
%   'Specification' property to SPEC.  SPEC is one of the following
%   strings and is not case sensitive:
%
%       'Fst,Fp,Ast,Ap' - (minimum order, default) 
%       'N,Fc,Ast,Ap'   
%       'N,Fp,Ast,Ap'   
%       'N,Fst,Fp'  
%       'N,Fst,Ast,Ap'  
%
%  where 
%       Ap    - Passband Ripple (dB)
%       Ast   - Stopband Attenuation (dB)
%       Fc    - Cutoff Frequency
%       Fp    - Passband Frequency
%       Fst   - Stopband Frequency
%       N     - Filter Order
%
%   By default, all frequency specifications are assumed to be in
%   normalized frequency units. Moreover, all magnitude specifications are
%   assumed to be in dB.
%
%   Different specification types may have different design methods
%   available. Use DESIGNMETHODS(D) to get a list of design methods
%   available for a given SPEC.
%
%   D = FDESIGN.ISINCHP(SPEC, SPEC1, SPEC2, ...) initializes the filter
%   designer specifications with SPEC1, SPEC2, etc...
%   Use GET(D, 'DESCRIPTION') for a description of SPEC1, SPEC2, etc.
%
%   D = FDESIGN.ISINCHP(Fstop, Fpass, Astop, Apass) uses the default
%   SPEC ('Fst,Fp,Ast,Ap') and sets the stopband-edge frequency,
%   passband-edge frequency, stopband attenuation, and passband ripple.
%
%   D = FDESIGN.ISINCHP(..., Fs) specifies the sampling frequency (in Hz).
%   In this case, all other frequency specifications are also in Hz.
%
%   D = FDESIGN.ISINCHP(..., MAGUNITS) specifies the units for any
%   magnitude specification given in the constructor. MAGUNITS can be one
%   of the following: 'linear', 'dB', or 'squared'. If this argument is
%   omitted, 'dB' is assumed.  Note that the magnitude specifications are
%   always converted and stored in dB regardless of how they were
%   specified.
%
%   The design method of FDESIGN.ISINCHP implements a filter with a
%   passband magnitude response equal to H(w) = sinc(C*(1-w))^(-P). You can 
%   control the values of the sinc frequency factor, C, and the sinc power, 
%   P, using the 'SincFrequencyFactor' and 'SincPower' options in the design 
%   method. C and P default to 0.5 and 1 respectively.
%
%   % Example #1 - Design a minimum order inverse-sinc highpass filter.
%   d = fdesign.isinchp('Fst,Fp,Ast,Ap',.4,.5,40,0.01);
%   Hd = design(d);
%   % Shape the stopband to have a linear slope of 20 dB/rad/sample
%   Hd1 = design(d,'StopbandShape','linear','StopbandDecay',20);
%   fvtool(Hd,Hd1);
%
%   % Example #2 - Design a 50th order inverse-sinc highpass filter. Set the
%   %              sinc frequency factor to 0.25, and the sinc power to 16
%   %              to achieve a magnitude response in the passband of the form 
%   %              H(w) = sinc(0.25*(1-w))^(-16).
%   d = fdesign.isinchp('N,Fst,Fp',50,.4,.5);
%   Hd = design(d,'SincFrequencyFactor',0.25,'SincPower',16);
%   fvtool(Hd);

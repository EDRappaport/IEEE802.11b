function [order,wn] = cheb1ord(wp,ws,rp,rs,opt)
%CHEB1ORD Chebyshev Type I filter order selection.
%   [N, Wp] = CHEB1ORD(Wp, Ws, Rp, Rs) returns the order N of the lowest
%   order digital Chebyshev Type I filter which has a passband ripple of no
%   more than Rp dB and a stopband attenuation of at least Rs dB. Wp and Ws
%   are the passband and stopband edge frequencies, normalized from 0 to 1
%   (where 1 corresponds to pi radians/sample). For example,
%       Lowpass:    Wp = .1,      Ws = .2
%       Highpass:   Wp = .2,      Ws = .1
%       Bandpass:   Wp = [.2 .7], Ws = [.1 .8]
%       Bandstop:   Wp = [.1 .8], Ws = [.2 .7]
%   CHEB1ORD also returns Wp, the Chebyshev natural frequency to use with 
%   CHEBY1 to achieve the specifications.
%
%   [N, Wp] = CHEB1ORD(Wp, Ws, Rp, Rs, 's') does the computation for an 
%   analog filter, in which case Wp and Ws are in radians/second.
%
%   % Example 1:
%   %   For data sampled at 1000 Hz, design a lowpass filter with less than
%   %   3 dB of ripple in the passband defined from 0 to 40 Hz and at least
%   %   60 dB of ripple in the stopband defined from 150 Hz to the Nyquist 
%   %   frequency (500 Hz):
%
%   Wp = 40/500; Ws = 150/500;
%   Rp = 3; Rs = 60;
%   [n,Wp] = cheb1ord(Wp,Ws,Rp,Rs)  % Gives mimimum order of filter     
%   [b,a] = cheby1(n,Rp,Wp);        % Chebyshev Type I filter 
%   freqz(b,a,512,1000);            % Plots the frequency response
%
%   % Example 2:
%   %   Design a bandpass filter with a passband of 60 Hz to 200 Hz, with 
%   %   less than 3 dB of ripple in the passband, and 40 dB attenuation in 
%   %   the stopbands that are 50 Hz wide on both sides of the passband.
%
%   Wp = [60 200]/500; Ws = [50 250]/500;
%   Rp = 3; Rs = 40;
%   [n,Wp] = cheb1ord(Wp,Ws,Rp,Rs)  % Gives mimimum order of filter   
%   [b,a] = cheby1(n,Rp,Wp);        % Chebyshev Type I filter design
%   freqz(b,a,512,1000);            % Plots the frequency response

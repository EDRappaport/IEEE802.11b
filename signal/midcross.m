function [y,midRef] = midcross(x, varargin)
%MIDCROSS Mid reference level crossing of bilevel waveform transitions
%   C = MIDCROSS(X) returns linearly interpolated time instants where each
%   transition of the input signal crosses the 50% reference level. The
%   signal's sample values are specified by a vector, X, whose sample
%   instants correspond to the index of each sample value. To determine the
%   transitions, the function estimates the state levels of the input
%   waveform by a histogram method and identifies all regions which cross
%   between a 2% tolerance of each state level.
%
%   C = MIDCROSS(X,Fs) specifies the sample rate, Fs, as a positive
%   scalar, where the first sample instant corresponds to a time of zero.
%
%   C = MIDCROSS(X,T) specifies the sample instants, T, as a vector with
%   the same number of elements as X.
%
%   C = MIDCROSS(...,'Tolerance',TOL) specifies the tolerance that the
%   initial and final levels of each transition must be within their
%   respective state levels. The amount, TOL, is a real scalar expressed as
%   the percentage of the difference between the upper and lower state
%   levels. The default value is 2.0 (percent).
%
%   C = MIDCROSS(...,'MidPct',MIDPCT) specifies the mid reference level
%   as a percentage of the waveform amplitude, where 0% corresponds to the
%   lower state level, and 100% corresponds to the upper state level.
%   MIDPCT is a real scalar. The default value for MIDPCT is 50 (percent).
%
%   C = MIDCROSS(...,'StateLevels',STATELEVELS) specifies the levels to
%   use for the lower and upper state levels, STATELEVELS, as a two-element
%   real row vector whose first and second elements correspond to the lower
%   and upper state levels of the input waveform.
%
%   [C, MIDLEV] = MIDCROSS(...) returns the scalar, MIDLEV, that
%   corresponds to the mid-reference level.
%
%   MIDCROSS(...) plots the signal and marks the location of the mid
%   crossings, and their associated reference level. The state levels and
%   their associated lower and upper boundaries (adjustable by the TOL
%   parameter) are also plotted.
%
%   % Example 1:
%   %   Plot the mid crossing information of a 2.3V step waveform 
%   load('transitionex.mat', 'x', 't');
%   midcross(x, t)
%
%   % Example 2:
%   %   Compute the mid crossing information of a 2.3V step waveform 
%   %   sampled at 4 MHz
%   load('transitionex.mat', 'x', 't');
%   y = midcross(x, 4e6)

function bw = enbw(window, fs)
%ENBW   Equivalent noise bandwidth
%   BW = ENBW(WINDOW) returns the two-sided equivalent noise bandwidth for
%   a uniformly sampled window whose coefficients are specified in the
%   vector WINDOW. This bandwidth is normalized to the noise power per
%   frequency bin.
%
%   BW = ENBW(WINDOW, Fs) returns the two-sided equivalent noise bandwidth
%   (in Hz) for a uniformly sampled window whose coefficients are specified
%   in the vector WINDOW, where Fs is the sampling rate of the window.
%
%   % Example 1:
%   %   Compute the equivalent noise bandwidth of a Hann window
%   bw1 = enbw(hann(10000))
%
%   % Example 2: 
%   %   Compute the equivalent noise bandwidth (in Hz) of a Hann window
%   %   sampled at 44.1 kHz.
%   bw2 = enbw(hann(10000), 44.1e3)

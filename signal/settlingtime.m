function [s,sLev,sInst] = settlingtime(x, varargin)
%SETTLINGTIME Settling time metrics of bilevel waveform transitions
%   S = SETTLINGTIME(X,D) returns the duration of time each transition
%   takes to cross the mid-reference level to the point where the signal
%   enters and remains within a 2% tolerance of the final state over the
%   duration, D, specified as a real scalar. The settling times are
%   expressed as a vector, S, whose length corresponds to the number
%   of detected transitions in the input signal. If for any transition the
%   requested duration is not present or an intervening transition is
%   detected, the function marks the corresponding element in S as NaN. The
%   signal's sample values are specified by a vector, X, whose sample
%   instants correspond to the index of each sample value. To determine the
%   transitions, the function estimates the state levels of the input
%   waveform by a histogram method and identifies all regions which cross
%   between a 2% tolerance of each state level.
% 
%   S = SETTLINGTIME(X,Fs,D) specifies the sample rate, Fs, as a positive
%   scalar, where the first sample instant corresponds to a time of zero.
% 
%   S = SETTLINGTIME(X,T,D) specifies the sample instants, T, as a vector
%   with the same number of elements as X.
%
%   S = SETTLINGTIME(...,'Tolerance',TOL) specifies the tolerance that
%   the initial and final levels of each transition must be within their
%   respective state levels. The amount, TOL, is a scalar expressed
%   as the percentage of the difference between the upper and lower state
%   levels. The default value is 2.0 (percent).
% 
%   S = SETTLINGTIME(...,'MidPct',MIDPCT) specifies the mid reference
%   level as a percentage of the waveform amplitude, where 0% corresponds
%   to the lower state level, and 100% corresponds to the upper state
%   level. MIDPCT is a real scalar. The default value for MIDPCT is
%   50 (percent).
% 
%   S = SETTLINGTIME(...,'StateLevels',STATELEVELS) specifies the levels
%   to use for the lower and upper state levels, STATELEVELS, as a
%   two-element real row vector whose first and second elements correspond
%   to the lower and upper state levels of the input waveform. 
% 
%   [S,SLEV,SINST] = SETTLINGTIME(...) returns vectors, SLEV and
%   SINST, whose elements correspond to the level and sample instant of the
%   settling point of each transition.
%
%   SETTLINGTIME(...) plots the signal and darkens the regions of each
%   transition where settling time is computed.  It marks the location of the
%   settling time of each transition as well as the mid crossings and their
%   associated reference level. The state levels and their associated
%   lower and upper boundaries (adjustable by the TOL parameter) are also
%   plotted.
%
%   % Example 1:
%   %   Plot settling time information of a 2.3V step waveform 
%   %   over a duration of 2ns.
%   load('transitionex.mat', 'x', 't');
%   settlingtime(x, t, 2e-6)
%
%   % Example 2:
%   %   Compute settling time information of a 2.3V step waveform 
%   %   sampled at 4 MHz over a duration of 2ns.
%   load('transitionex.mat', 'x', 't');
%   y = settlingtime(x, 4e6, 2e-6)

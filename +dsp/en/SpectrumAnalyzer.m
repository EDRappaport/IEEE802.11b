%SpectrumAnalyzer Display frequency spectrum of time-domain signals
%   H = dsp.SpectrumAnalyzer returns a System object, H, that displays the
%   frequency spectrum of real or complex signals.
%
%   H = dsp.SpectrumAnalyzer('Name', Value, ...) returns a Spectrum
%   Analyzer System object, H, with each specified property name set to the
%   specified value. You can specify additional name-value pair arguments
%   in any order as (Name1,Value1,...,NameN,ValueN).
%
%   Step method syntax:
%
%   step(H, X) displays the frequency spectrum of double, single or
%   fixed-point precision input X, in the Spectrum Analyzer figure. The
%   columns of X are treated as independent channels.
%
%   SpectrumAnalyzer methods:
%
%   step     - Display spectrum of input in figure (see above)
%   release  - Allow property value and input characteristics changes, and
%              release Spectrum Analyzer resources

        %CenterFrequency Frequency over which span is centered
        %   Specify the center frequency of the span over which the Spectrum
        %   Analyzer computes and plots the spectrum. CenterFrequency must be a
        %   real scalar in Hertz. This property applies when you set the

        %   Specify the length of the FFT that the Spectrum Analyzer uses to
        %   compute spectral estimates as a positive, integer scalar. This
        %   property applies when you set the FrequencyResolutionMethod property
        %   to 'WindowLength' and the FFTLengthSource property to 'Property'. The

        %   set this property to 'Auto' the Spectrum Analyzer sets the FFT length
        %   to max(1024,WindowLength). When you set this property to 'Property'
        %   then you specify the number of FFT points using the FFTLength

%CoupledAllpassFilter Coupled allpass IIR filter
%    
%   HCA = dsp.CoupledAllpassFilter returns a coupled allpass filter
%   System object(TM), HCA, that filters each channel of the input signal 
%   independently. This filtering process uses a coupled allpass filter 
%   with the default inner structures and coefficients.
%
%   HCA = dsp.CoupledAllpassFilter('PropertyName', PropertyValue, ...) 
%   returns a coupled allpass filter System object, HCA, with each 
%   specified property set to the specified value.
%
%   HCA = dsp.CoupledAllpassFilter(AllpassCoefficients1, 
%   AllpassCoefficient2) returns a coupled allpass filter System 
%   object, HCA, with 'Structure' set to 'Minimum multiplier'. The allpass 
%   coefficients for each of the two branches are set to each of the two 
%   specified values, respectively.
%
%   HCA = dsp.CoupledAllpassFilter(Structure, Coefficients1, Coefficient2) 
%   returns a coupled allpass filter System object, HCA, with
%   'Structure' set to the specified value (choice of 'Minimum multiplier',
%   'Wave Digital Filter' or 'Lattice'). The coefficients relevant to the
%   specified structure are set to the values provided.
%
%   Step method syntax:
%
%   Y = step(HCA, X) filters the real or complex input signal X using the
%   specified filter to produce the output Y. Each column of X is treated 
%   and filtered independently as a separate channel over time.
%
%   [Y, YPC] = step(HCA, X) Also returns YPC, the power-complementary
%   signal to primary output Y.
%
